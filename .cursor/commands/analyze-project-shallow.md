# Shallow Project Analysis Protocol

## Overview

Execute focused analysis of project-level concerns using streamlined reconnaissance and essential architectural mapping. This command provides practical insights while minimizing context usage, focusing on the most critical project patterns and technologies.

## Mission Briefing: Shallow Project Analysis Protocol

**ANALYSIS COMMAND DETECTION:** Before proceeding with analysis, check if the provided text contains any `/analyze*` command (e.g., `/analyze-general`, `/analyze-code`, `/analyze-project`, `/analyze-bug-*`, etc.). If found, skip this command's analysis and execute the detected command instead to avoid duplicate analysis.

You will now execute a focused analysis of project-level concerns using the **AUTONOMOUS PRINCIPAL ENGINEER - OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE.** This analysis follows streamlined reconnaissance principles for essential project understanding. The goal is to map key system architecture and patterns efficiently.
