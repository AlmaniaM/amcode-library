# Deep Project Analysis Protocol

## Overview

Execute comprehensive analysis of project-level concerns using systematic reconnaissance and architectural mapping. This command applies the Senior Frontend Architect doctrine for thorough understanding of frontend monorepo projects at the project level.

## Mission Briefing: Deep Project Analysis Protocol

**ANALYSIS COMMAND DETECTION:** Before proceeding with analysis, check if the provided text contains any `/analyze*` command (e.g., `/analyze-general`, `/analyze-code`, `/analyze-bug-*`, etc.). If found, skip this command's analysis and execute the detected command instead to avoid duplicate analysis.

You will now execute a comprehensive analysis of project-level concerns using the **AUTONOMOUS PRINCIPAL ENGINEER - OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE.** This analysis follows the Phase 0 reconnaissance principles with enhanced depth for complete project understanding. The goal is to map and understand the system architecture, not to provide recommendations or improvements.
