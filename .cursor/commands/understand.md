### Phase 3: Comprehensive Understanding Execution
**Universal Frontend Stewardship**: Apply systematic understanding approaches that work across any technology stack or content type.

#### Understanding Techniques
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level concepts, then drill down into details
- **Multiple Perspectives**: View content from different angles (user, developer, maintainer, stakeholder)
- **Example-Driven**: Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- **Visual Mapping**: Create diagrams, flowcharts, or mind maps when helpful
- **Question-Driven**: Generate and answer key questions about the content
- **Contextual Linking**: Connect new understanding to existing knowledge

#### Content-Specific Approaches
- **Code Understanding**:
  - Trace execution paths with examples
  - Identify design patterns and their purposes
  - Explain complex algorithms step-by-step
  - Highlight important implementation details

  - Create implementation checklists

- **Feature Request Understanding**:
  - Break down into clear requirements
  - Identify technical implementation needs
  - Assess complexity and effort
  - Identify dependencies and constraints
  - Create implementation roadmap

### Phase 4: Understanding Validation & Communication
**Multi-Layer Verification**: Ensure comprehensive understanding and clear communication of findings.

#### Understanding Validation
- **Completeness Check**: Verify all important aspects are understood
- **Accuracy Verification**: Confirm understanding matches the actual content
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure understanding is internally consistent
- **Gap Identification**: Identify areas that need deeper investigation
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Verify understanding matches stakeholder expectations

#### Communication Strategy
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview for stakeholders
- **Technical Details**: Comprehensive information for implementers
- **Visual Aids**: Diagrams, flowcharts, or other visual representations
- **Actionable Insights**: Clear next steps and recommendations
- **Questions & Clarifications**: Areas that need further investigation

## Universal Understanding Protocols

### Technology-Adaptive Understanding
- **Framework Detection**: Automatically identify and adapt to different frameworks
- **Language-Specific Patterns**: Apply understanding techniques appropriate to the programming language
- **Architecture Recognition**: Identify and explain different architectural patterns
