# Status Tracking Requirement

## 🎯 MISSION STATEMENT

**MANDATORY STATUS TRACKING**: Every LLM session working on implementation MUST maintain comprehensive status tracking to enable seamless handoff between different AI agents and ensure project continuity.

## 🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY STATUS TRACKING
**Every implementation session MUST maintain comprehensive status tracking for multi-session continuity.**

#### Required Status Artifacts

- **Next Session Brief**: Clear instructions for the next LLM session

#### Status Tracking Format
```markdown
## Implementation Status Report
**Session Date**: [Date]
**Session Duration**: [Duration]
**LLM Session ID**: [Session Identifier]

### Completed Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: [Description] - [Status: Completed/In Progress/Blocked]
- [ ] Task 2: [Description] - [Status: Completed/In Progress/Blocked]

### Progress Summary
- **Tasks Completed**: [Number] of [Total]

- **Environment**: [Current environment and configuration state]
```

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Session Start Requirements
- **Status Assessment**: MUST assess current status at session start

### Session End Requirements
- **Status Documentation**: MUST document complete status at session end
- **Handoff Preparation**: MUST prepare handoff for next session
- **Context Preservation**: MUST preserve all relevant context
- **Next Steps Definition**: MUST clearly define next steps

- **Clarity**: Information must be clear and understandable
- **Actionability**: Information must lead to clear next steps
- **Timeliness**: Information must be current and up-to-date
- **Accuracy**: Information must be accurate and verified

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

### Status Tracking Anti-Patterns
- **FORBIDDEN**: Starting implementation without status assessment
- **FORBIDDEN**: Ending session without status documentation
- **FORBIDDEN**: Incomplete context preservation
- **FORBIDDEN**: Vague or unclear next steps
- **FORBIDDEN**: Missing quality gate status
- **FORBIDDEN**: Incomplete issue logging
- **FORBIDDEN**: Missing blocker documentation

### Handoff Anti-Patterns
- **FORBIDDEN**: Incomplete handoff preparation
- **FORBIDDEN**: Missing context documentation
- **FORBIDDEN**: Unclear next steps definition
- **FORBIDDEN**: Incomplete status reporting
- **FORBIDDEN**: Missing quality gate status
- **FORBIDDEN**: Incomplete issue resolution status
