# Parallelization Standards

## 🎯 MISSION STATEMENT

**MANDATORY PARALLELIZATION**: Every large-scale plan MUST be broken down into independent, parallel-executable phases that can be tackled by multiple LLMs simultaneously without dependencies.

## 🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY PHASE INDEPENDENCE
**Every parallel phase MUST be completely independent with zero dependencies on other phases.**

#### Phase Independence Requirements
- **Zero Dependencies**: Phases cannot depend on outputs from other phases
- **Resource Isolation**: Phases cannot compete for the same resources
- **Data Isolation**: Phases cannot have data conflicts or dependencies
- **Interface Independence**: Phases must have clearly defined, stable interfaces
- **Timeline Independence**: Phases can be executed in any order or simultaneously

#### Dependency Elimination
- **Dependency Analysis**: MUST analyze all task dependencies before parallelization
- **Dependency Removal**: MUST remove or redesign dependencies where possible
- **Interface Design**: MUST design clean interfaces between phases
- **Resource Planning**: MUST plan resource allocation to avoid conflicts
- **Data Partitioning**: MUST partition data to avoid conflicts

### PHASE BOUNDARY DEFINITION
**Every phase MUST have clearly defined boundaries and interfaces.**

#### Clear Phase Boundaries
- **Scope Definition**: Each phase has a clearly defined scope
- **Input Requirements**: Each phase has clearly defined input requirements
- **Output Specifications**: Each phase has clearly defined output specifications
- **Quality Gates**: Each phase has clearly defined quality gates
- **Success Criteria**: Each phase has clearly defined success criteria

#### Interface Specifications
- **Input Interfaces**: Clear specification of what each phase needs as input
- **Output Interfaces**: Clear specification of what each phase produces
- **Integration Points**: Clear specification of how phases integrate
- **Data Contracts**: Clear specification of data formats and structures
- **API Contracts**: Clear specification of API interfaces

### WORKLOAD BALANCING
**Phases MUST be balanced in terms of workload, complexity, and resources.**

#### Workload Distribution
- **Task Distribution**: Tasks must be distributed evenly across phases
- **Complexity Balancing**: Complexity must be balanced across phases
- **Duration Balancing**: Estimated duration must be balanced across phases
- **Resource Balancing**: Resource requirements must be balanced
- **Risk Balancing**: Risks must be distributed evenly

#### Resource Management
- **Resource Allocation**: Each phase must have allocated resources
- **Resource Isolation**: Phases must not compete for resources
- **Resource Optimization**: Resources must be optimally utilized
- **Resource Monitoring**: Resource usage must be monitored
- **Resource Scaling**: Resource scaling must be planned

## 🔧 PARALLELIZATION METHODOLOGIES

### DEPENDENCY-BASED PARALLELIZATION
**Break down plans based on dependency analysis and critical path optimization.**

#### Critical Path Analysis
- **Dependency Mapping**: Map all task dependencies
- **Critical Path Identification**: Identify the critical path
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Identify parallel execution opportunities
- **Dependency Elimination**: Remove dependencies where possible
- **Timeline Optimization**: Optimize for parallel execution

#### Interface Design
- **Clean Interfaces**: Design clean, minimal interfaces
- **Stable Contracts**: Ensure interface contracts are stable
- **Version Management**: Plan for interface versioning
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure backward compatibility
- **Documentation**: Document all interfaces thoroughly

### FEATURE-BASED PARALLELIZATION
**Break down plans based on independent features and components.**

#### Feature Isolation
- **Feature Identification**: Identify independent features
- **Component Separation**: Separate independent components
- **Service Decomposition**: Decompose into independent services
- **Data Partitioning**: Partition data for independent processing
- **API Separation**: Separate APIs for independent development

#### Component Independence
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one responsibility
- **Loose Coupling**: Components are loosely coupled
- **High Cohesion**: Components have high internal cohesion
- **Interface Segregation**: Components have focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Components depend on abstractions

### RESOURCE-BASED PARALLELIZATION
**Break down plans based on available resources and capabilities.**

#### Resource Allocation
- **Resource Assessment**: Assess available resources
- **Capability Mapping**: Map LLM capabilities to phases
- **Workload Distribution**: Distribute work based on capabilities
- **Resource Optimization**: Optimize resource utilization
- **Scaling Planning**: Plan for resource scaling

#### Capability Matching
- **Skill Assessment**: Assess LLM skills and expertise
- **Task Matching**: Match tasks to LLM capabilities
- **Learning Planning**: Plan for skill development
- **Mentoring**: Plan for knowledge transfer
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure quality across all phases

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN PARALLELIZATION PATTERNS
